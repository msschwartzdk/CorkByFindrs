Comments to the App design from a complete rookie.

*** BLE scanning in foreground and background.
To scan for both foreign and own devices, the Android Beacon Library is used.
A beacon scanner is started, looking for NORMAL and ALERT UUIDs in range.
Beacon scanner functionality is very sensitive to PERMISSIONS_GRANTED.
It has turned out that permissions must be handled in to runs.
First, the so called foreground permissions. When granted then background permissions.
To let the scanner run in the background, a foreground service is required.
The service is started when App is launched.

*** Viewmodels and Repositories
As usual viewmodels are used to shared data between activities/BLE manager and UI (composables)
However, as the beacon manager is started from the foreground service, a repository is used to
link the beacon manager with the viewmodel (not sure I understand all the details).
Anyway, the repository (BleRepository) is updated inside the BleManager shared with BleViewModel.
This way BleManager updates are made available to UI through the BleViewModel (smart?)
